Introduction
============
The project represents a set of utility classes and wrappers around [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/).

Download
========
You can download pre-built binaries directly from the [github downloads page](https://github.com/linkedin/linkedin-zookeeper/downloads)

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-server-<version>.tgz`:
  A simple to use prepackaged zookeeper distribution:

        ./bin/zkServer.sh start

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-cli-<version>.tgz`:
  A command line (similar to the one bundled with ZooKeeper) with the idea of having a syntax very close to a 'regular' shell:

          zk.sh ls /a/b/c
          zk.sh du /a/b/d
          zk.sh put localFile.txt /a/b/c
          zk.sh cat /a/b/c
          etc...

Compilation
===========
In order to compile the code you need

* java 1.6

At the top simply run

    ./gradlew test

which should compile and run all the tests.

IDE Support
===========
You can issue the command (at the top)

    ./gradlew cleanIdea idea

which will use the gradle IDEA plugin to create the right set of modules in order to open the
project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Directory structure
===================

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-impl`:
Contains a set of utility classes and wrappers to make it easier to use ZooKeeper:

  * `IZooKeeper` is an interface/abstraction to ZooKeeper (which is (unfortunately) a class)
  * `IZKClient` (which extends from `IZooKeeper`) adds a host of convenient calls and lifecycle listeners
  * `ZooKeeperURLHandler` is a URL handler which knows how to handle `zookeeper:/a/b/c` type urls
  * `ZooKeeperTreeTracker` (the core of this project) essentially keeps an in memory replica of a portion
of a tree or entire subtree with easy to use listeners (`NodeEventsListener` and `ErrorListener`): you get notified when nodes are added, updated or deleted (you never deal with ZooKeeper watchers, nor have to set them over and over!). You can see a good example of how to use this class in the glu project [org.linkedin.glu.agent.tracker.AgentsTrackerImpl](https://github.com/linkedin/glu/blob/master/agent/org.linkedin.glu.agent-tracker/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/glu/agent/tracker/AgentsTrackerImpl.groovy)
  * `StandaloneZooKeeperServer`: a simple class to start a standalone ZooKeeper server (simple to use
in testing)

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-cli-impl`:
A command line (similar to the one bundled with ZooKeeper) with the idea of having a syntax very close to a 'regular' shell:

        zk.sh ls /a/b/c
        zk.sh du /a/b/d
        zk.sh put localFile.txt /a/b/c
        zk.sh cat /a/b/c
        etc...

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-cli`:
Create the packaged version of the cli.

* `org.linkedin.zookeeper-server`:
Simply create a packaged server which is easy to install and start. Useful in dev.

5. Installing/Running locally
-----------------------------
To install the zookeeper server:

    cd org.linkedin.zookeeper-server
    ../gradlew package-install

then go to the install directory and run 

    ./bin/zkServer start

To install the zookeeper cli:

    cd org.linkedin.zookeeper-cli
    ../gradlew package-install

then go to the install directory and run (to see help)

    ./bin/zk.sh -h

and then try

    ./bin/zk.sh ls /

which returns

    zookeeper

Note: it should work on any Linux/Unix based system (developped/tested on Mac OS X)

Build configuration
===================
The project uses the [`org.linkedin.userConfig`](https://github.com/linkedin/gradle-plugins/blob/master/README.md) plugin and as such can be configured

    Example:
    ~/.userConfig.properties
    top.build.dir="/Volumes/Disk2/deployment/${userConfig.project.name}"
    top.install.dir="/export/content/${userConfig.project.name}"
    top.release.dir="/export/content/repositories/release"
    top.publish.dir="/export/content/repositories/publish"
